    <h2>Unrated and rank</h2>
    The Unrated and rank are the most popular modes for players. Unrated is more relax mode than rank.
    Valorant has a rank system just like all competitive FPS games.Valorant's ranked system for the most part is fairly straightforward. 
    There are 9 different ranks that you can achieve, and within the first 8 ranks, there are 3 different tiers. In ascending order, 
    these ranks are called: <br>
    Iron <br>
    Bronze <br>
    Silver <br>
    Gold <br>
    Platinum <br>
    Diamond <br>
    Ascendant <br>
    Immortal <br>
    Radiant (Previously known as Valorant) <br>

    <h2>Swift play and Spike rush</h2>
    These two modes are the most relax modes in the game. <br>
    <h4>Swift play</h4>
    Swiftplay is a best-of-nine game mode in VALORANT that is available as a condensed alternative to Unrated. This is way more fater to play than unrated. <br>
    <h4>Spike rush</h4>
    Spike Rush is a faster-paced game mode. Pre-round time is reduced to 20 seconds (usually 30) and game time is reduced to 80 seconds (usually 100). 
    While the attackers have less time to plant, they also have the advantage of each player having a spike. The game ends when one team reaches 4 round wins, 
    teams switch sides after 3 rounds. <br>
    Spike Rush has different <b>mechanics</b> than other modes. <br>
